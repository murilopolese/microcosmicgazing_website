# Intro

- Promo

I applied Microcosmic Gazing to Visualia's micro-residency at Unnaryd and got accepted together with [Erik](https://eriknatanael.com/) and [Hara](https://haraalonso.com/).

The residency happened at Folkhemmet Unnaryd and we presented our work at Into The Woods festival.

[Leo](https://www.instagram.com/leopahta/), [Merle](https://merlekarp.com/), [Tomas](https://www.tomaslarssonmusic.com/) and the residency host/organizer, [Jonas](https://jonasjohansson.se), were also part of the residency and festival.

My dear friend Pedro is the responsible for the beautiful pictures that will illustrate this documentation. He was also my legs when I hurt my foot and an anchor during the tides.

Ellen, Rose and Jessica arrived in waves during the residency and were each essential part of the performances, amphitheater setup and warm energy who I'm convinced everybody felt!

# Context

- Old gallery

- [VISUALIA](https://visualia.se/) is a playground for audiovisual excursion, education and live performance.
- [Into the Woods](https://www.intothewoods.se/) is an off-grid festival deep inside the Swedish forest. The landscape is natural with a beautiful little lake as the backdrop for the stage. "We strive to make the festival as sustainable as possible."
- [Folkhemmet/Solsidan's](https://www.folkhemmetunnaryd.com/) cultural association is a non-profit association and functions as an umbrella for local companies and individual companies in Unnaryd with culture as the main common denominator.  The board consists of a group of independent cultural creators living around Kroksjön outside Unnaryd, active in music, art and woodcraft, among other things.
- [Microcosmic Gazing](http://microcosmicgazing.bananabanana.me/) is a gathering and performance. We meet to wonder about the microscopic, microbiotic, microcosmic reality around and inside us. From time to time we partner with different kinds of humans to explore, create and gaze together.

# Residency

During the residency time what I remember the most were the walks.
Walking to explore, walking to eat, walking to see something or someone.

We went for walks in the morning: Cloud gazing, poking bark, inspecting moss.
At the house, J would be waiting to look with us at the microscope.
J an 8-year old German neighbor who couldn't communicate using English or Swedish.

Just like J, everybody passing would approach to understand what was happening.
I really enjoy to watch people react to it either they love or totally ignore.

Summer gives us short nights so as soon as sun was down, we were testing projectors.
That gave us a lot of free and meditative time during the days.
I even made a small beer can berimbau.

# Thoughts

- Bonding
- People on microscopes

Somehow it amazed people to know the abstract and magic images they were looking at night came from the lake they were bathing during the day.

A few people questioned "what am I looking at?", sometimes I felt that knowing the names and species would bring some peace of mind to them.

Most people made a "WOW!" sound when they were playing with the hand microscope as they adjusted the focus. I believe the most important part was that *they* were adjusting the focus.

The "best images" came from a sample that brewed for a couple of days and from a still puddle by the lake.

Talking about Dave Ackley's quote on large and small and Jay Silver's re-seeing the world through lenses was the underlying theme of the most interesting conversations.

Even not speaking the same language, somehow my communication with J was guided by the joy and surprise of looking at reality. Experiencing re-seeing the world. When I had to tell him why I was leaving or when to meet again I used a translation app with text to speak.

During the residency, I befriended the oldest child of a german family camping behind Folkhemmet. Jan didn't speak any English or Swedish so our verbal communication was choppy and assisted mainly by google translator. On the other side, our body and emotional communication was fluid and engaged. Every morning Jan would wait for me outside the house to look at the microscope and show their collected samples. At a certain point we even played berimbau together. When we met, after realizing spoken language wasn't an option, I handed the pocket microscope and the joy of re-sei g plain reality took care of connecting us. Her mother was specially happy because it seems Jan has a hard time focusing on school business and only had patience when fishing. This was probably the deepest connection I had during the festival and I can't help but wonder what all this meant for them.

# Thank you

There is a whole village to thank, kind of literally. I'm blessed by the kindness of everybody involved on the festival and the collectives supporting it.

Thank you Jonas for being the person behind every time there is a Microcosmic Gazing and by doing this enabling a dream and a project that means so much for me.

I'm eternally thankful to be next to and sharing the hole process with my good old friend Pedro. This multiplied my joy greatly!

Forest Walk Script

Script:

Invitation: Would you like to join on a microcosmic gazing forest walk? We are going to have a walk until the amphitheater, through the forest with gazing opportunities. Then at the amphitheater we are going to have some music and chat.

Welcome, let's do a round of introductions? Please say your name and your favorite forest sound.

Cool, so let's get into the woods! We'll make make 3 stops until the amphitheater and we should start walking to the first one.

Here is good.

There are things that are big and move very slowly.
We call them constant.
There are tiny things that move very fast.
We call them random.
Then in the middle, there are things we see causes for.
We call them interesting.

This slice in the middle of the spectrum,
the things that we find interesting,
we can modulate that

it's hard and takes some practice
but should we give a try?
I will invite you now to look at the sky,
find a cloud and look how it's moving
You can pick a binoculars to look at
(moment)

Very well! Shall we move to the next stop?

Here is good!

Does anyone here practice meditation or something like that? Have you tried body scanning? How would you explain it?

Now I am going to invite you to do a moss scanning
try to not leave nothing behind
and don't forget to breathe
you can pick the microscope to look at
(moment)

Beautiful! Let's start moving to the next checkpoint?

Here we are!

We experience the world through lenses
Altered perceptions
Seeing blocks
